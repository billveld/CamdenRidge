            <h4>Roswell Goes from Good to Great </h4>
            On May 7th, USA Today came out with the top ten best places to raise your family. Roswell, GA placed 3rd. The information came from a new book out authored by Bert Sperling and Peter Sander, Best Places to Raise Your Family: The Top 100 Affordable Communities in the U.S. (Frommer's, $24.99). The "Best of the Best" towns won their berths by coming out on top in the book's major categories: demographics, standard of living, education, lifestyle, health and safety. But "a place is much more than just statistics," Sperling says. "You can have good feelings about a place, as we did." Also, Mimosa Elementary on Warsaw will be a stop on a cross-state bus trip (Sept 26th) taken by a select group of educators and leaders in business and government as well as in the community. Mimosa is one of 15 schools chosen out of 119 schools considered by the Georgia Partnership for Excellence to be on the organizations’ Bus Trip Across Georgia. To be selected as a tour stop, a school must demonstrate a record of academic excellence, educational innovation and sustained performance.
