<p>On behalf of the Camden Ridge Home Owners' Association in general and the Board of Directors and residents in particular, I would like to personally welcome you to our community and website.</p>
<p> Centrally located, Camden Ridge provides easy access to the best Roswell and Alpharetta has to offer. Many say that location is everything and you can have it at Camden Ridge. </p>
<p>Our residents enjoy living only minutes away from great shopping, mass transportation, diverse restaurants, community activities and outdoor recreation. You are a short distance from the lush greenbelts of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area where you will find a delightful wildlife preserve with playgrounds, picnic areas, as well as foot and bike paths. You can also take a trip down the river in a raft, canoe, or kayak. </p>
<p>As a covenant controlled neighborhood, we make every effort to preserve, enhance, and protect the property values and assets within our community making Camden Ridge an aesthetically pleasing neighborhood that is easy on the eye. Our neighborhood is marked by a sociable sense of warmth and comfort making Camden Ridge also easy on the spirit. </p>
<p>Whether you are a new resident or one who has resided in our neighborhood for many years, we ask that you assist us in continually improving our community. Please let us know your ideas and your willingness to volunteer on our committees or board.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions, complaints, concerns, or would like to volunteer to participate on any of our committees and community activities, please feel free to directly contact Beth Barrett at Community Management Associates bbarrett@cmacommunities.com.</p>
<p> In closing, I would like to personally thank you for allowing me the opportunity to serve as your HOA President. I will carry out the duties of my office with honor and will continually strive to enhance and preserve the reputation of Camden Ridge. </p>
<p>Tremendously,</p>
<p> Camden Ridge Board of Directors</p>
